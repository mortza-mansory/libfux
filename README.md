##  What's New in the Latest Version?

The new version of the code is **much simpler and cleaner**. Here's a quick look at the key improvements:

-  **No ContextProvider Needed**  
  Direct access to app state with `AppContext::instance()`. No nested contexts.

-  **Simplified Dialogs**  
  Just use `showDialog(...)` â€” no manual state or `If(...)` checks.

-  **Easy Reactivity with Obx**  
  Use `Obx([] { ... })` for auto-updating widgets based on state.

-  **One-Line SnackBars**  
  Show snackbars instantly without setup:
Example: The main.cpp is your example only put it on your visual studio, config the SDL lib and enjoy power of simplify.
